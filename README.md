## 🔍 Overview
The **Anoma Intent Playground** is a **user-friendly web application** that allows users to explore **Anoma’s Intents system**.

- Users can input their **intent**, for example:  
  - “I want to swap 10 USDC for 0.01 ETH”  
  - “I want to sell my NFT only via a private swap”

- The app converts this intent into a **JSON-formatted Intent Transaction**.  
- A demo **matching engine** then simulates potential matches, showing results via animation.  

✨ **Demo Flow:** Enter Intent → View JSON → See Matching Result
