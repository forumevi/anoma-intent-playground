🔍 Overview

The Anoma Intent Playground is a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore Anoma’s Intents system.

Users can input their intent, for example:

“I want to swap 10 USDC for 0.01 ETH”

“I want to sell my NFT only via a private swap”

The app converts this intent into a JSON-formatted Intent Transaction.

A demo matching engine then simulates potential matches, showing results via animation.

✨ Demo Flow: Enter Intent → View JSON → See Matching Result

⚙️ How It Works

User Interface – Simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.

Intent Generation – Converts user’s textual intent into structured JSON transactions.

Matching Simulation – Demo engine visualizes possible matches with animation.
